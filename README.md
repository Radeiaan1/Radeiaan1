## I am currently:

## I am generally:

## Things i'd like to learn:
- Gazebo(modelling software) which we will be using in Semester4
- dev containers for clean development of code
- pipelines for streamlining development and deployment
- CSS, JavaScript and HTML for gaining basic/developing web coding skills


## I have: 
helped build and deliver a spectrometer using the AS7265x spectrale sensor for [SRON](https://www.sron.nl/en/). I have also helped build software for this spectrometer which can display live measurements, create measurements for comparison, save measurements in a CSv file, etc. The link to that folder is [here
](https://github.com/2025-TICT-TV2SE3-24-1-V/project-fiveguys/tree/main/SpectRONvanFiveGuysHU), though it might be private since that repo is managed by my school.

## ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages(of which 2 are unofficial) and love doing different accents.
